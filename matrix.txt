How to Create and Manipulate a Matrix in Python?
In Python, matrices can be created and manipulated using lists of lists or using libraries such as NumPy for more efficient and convenient matrix operations.


Creating a Matrix with Lists:


# Creating a matrix using nested lists
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
Manipulating a Matrix:


# Accessing elements
element = matrix[1][2]  # Accessing the element at row 1, column 2 (6)

# Modifying elements
matrix[2][1] = 10  # Setting the element at row 2, column 1 to 10
